# A-full-fledged-network-for-an-organization-with-multiple-subnets-using-Packet-Tracer
INTERNATIONAL Apollo University, is an enterprise like East West University, owns a large number of computers, with a complex network infrastructure. Apart from wired internet access to all the classrooms, labs, employee PCs, library, and other administrative and academic wings, the university also provides wireless internet access for everyone. On top of that, the university runs a number of complex networked systems to support several of its business process like admissions, advising, results, eTender, library management, accounts, and so on.  

Task  

Your task is to create a complete model of a complex network by discovering the interconnectivity of the systems and subnetworks, which will reflect the INTERNATIONAL Apollo University’s structure and facilities, features within the network will include the followings:  
1. Web page of the university will reflect International Apollo University’s web page. 
2. DNS server needs to be installed to locate webserver - meaning people will browse University’s web site with the following address: http://www.apollointernational.edu 
3. Among the hosts make sure wireless links to the networks are available. 
4. University’s full network has covered its six campuses with six routers, connectivity between routers are mesh (complex). 
5. Connectivity between all the hosts needs to be established.  

While designing, keep the issue of future expansion/growth in mind for each of the subnets (if required) and preserve spaces. It is compulsory to incorporate wireless devices along with wired hosts in the LAN as well. In the physical design, there should be a server room where all the servers are positioned in one LAN segment.   

Features  

1. The whole network in such a way that IP for the hosts of different campuses will be automatically assigned by a single DHCP server. 
2.  Network addresses will be from all 3 classes. 
3.  Incorporation of subnets
